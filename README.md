# Foto Finder
> A web-based application that allows user to add and edit photos

The Foto-Finder app allows a user to add photos with titles and captions, with the ability to favorite and remove them once added. Photos are then saved to local storage storage which allows users to make adjustments after their initial upload. Users are also able to search through their photos based on their titles and captions.
